This app assists users in keeping up with the library books they have checked out and their due dates.

Users can browse all books or look at only the books they have checked out. If the user wants a book that is already checked out, they may reserve the book and will get a push notification whenever the bookÂ is available.

All information in the database updates live, so if someone checks out a book while you have the app open it will show up in a matter of seconds.

The app is designed to be used when the user is checking out physical books at the library. They can check out the books on the app and it will set up the due date and remind the user when it is overdue.
